# Veritone Ordered List

A simple app that renders a list in ascending or descending order. It's a [`create-react-app`][cra] application and can be booted by running:

```bash
‚ùØ yarn start
```

This will build the code and then boot up the development server. To see the app, point your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/).

The app uses Formik for form state and Styled-Components for css.
